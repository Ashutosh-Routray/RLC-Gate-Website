          <span style="font-weight: 900;">About the course:</span> In these critical times, students can attend online GATE classes from home on Weekdays. Classes are conducted using Google Education Suite applications.<br>
          
          <span style="font-weight: 900;">Why this course:</span> Do you want to join IISc/IITs for higher studies? Then this is the right course for you! At RLC, you learn each subject systematically and comprehensively. Our focus is on the depth of understanding, and the joy of learning that results. You will gain confidence in subjects by mastering the concepts and innovative problem solving techniques, leading to an excellent performance in GATE!<br>
          
          <span style="font-weight: 900;">Enjoy the learning process!</span> Joy and learning are not commonly found together, especially in a mathematically oriented branch like EC. But joy of learning forms the core philosophy at RLC. To become an EC expert, you need top-notch teachers. You also need an interactive classroom environment where freely discussing a concept in all its aspects and exploring interconnections between concepts are encouraged. Such an approach makes the learning process interesting and enjoyable. For evidence, look at our <a href="../testimonials/index.html">testimonials</a> page!<br>

<!-- <div class="pride"> How to excel&nbsp;<span style="color:#00008B">GATE</span>?</div>
        <div class="main-gate-info">
There is a widespread notion that GATE is not easy to crack, and that it is very difficult to get a good score in GATE. Is this true?
<br>
The answer is an emphatic <span style="color:red;font-weight: 900;">NO</span>! You only need proper preparation to excel in GATE. You don’t need to be a genius to get a rank under 100. You only need to be smart enough to prepare properly, along with a strong motivation towards excellence.
<br><br>
For an excellent performance in GATE, two things are essential:
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 900;">i. A comprehensive understanding of concepts</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: 900;">ii. Extensive Practice</span><br>
<br>
Let us consider the importance of concepts with a simple example:
<br><br>
<div class="mdex">The power of the signal x(t)=2 cos100πt-5 sin100πt is _____________</div>
<br>
The question is quite straightforward. To answer this question, you need to know the following concepts:<br>
<span style="font-weight: 900;">i. Power of a sinusoid</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: 900;">ii. Orthogonality of sin and cosine signals of the same frequency</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: 900;">iii. Power of a sum of orthogonal signals</span><br>
If you know these three concepts, the answer is direct. You’d probably have encountered such questions in your tests/exams. Now consider the next example:
<br><br>
<div class="mdex">The power of the signal x(t)=2 cos100πt-5sin[(100πt-π/3)] is _____________</div>
<br>
This question adds <span style="font-weight: 900;">phase shift</span> as a new parameter to the previous question. Now we cannot add the powers of the two components of <span style="font-weight: 900;">x(t)</span> directly.<br>
To answer this question, you need to know
<br>
The formula for <span style="font-weight: 900;">sin(A-B)</span>, so that <span style="font-weight: 900;">x(t)</span> can be expressed once again in terms of orthogonal components, or
<br>Phasor diagram<br>

<br>
Thus, the second question adds something extra to the first one, to make it more challenging. This is typical of GATE questions. In fact, the same concept can be tested in a broader context. Consider the following example:
<br><br>
<div class="mdex">The signal x(t)=cos100πt+2 sin[(120πt-π/3)] is SSB-USB modulated, with both the in-phase and quadrature carriers having an amplitude of 3V. The power of the modulated signal is ____________</div>
<br>
To answer this question, you should know
<br>
Whether the two components of x(t) are orthogonal<br>
To calculate the power of x(t), and the relation between the power of the message signal and modulated signal in SSB, or
<br>To plot the power spectrum of the modulated signal and find its power.<br>
From the examples discussed, we can make some observations:
<br>
A typical GATE question requires you to know many different concepts.<br>
You should also know how to connect the different concepts together to get the correct answer. <br>This is where practice helps.
Concepts in fundamental subjects like signals and systems form the basis of those in advanced subjects like communication. So you need to have a proper focus on fundamental subjects.
