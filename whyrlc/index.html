        <div class="main-gate-info">
            <!-- GATE stands for Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering. It is conducted jointly by IISc and seven IITs. It tests the subject knowledge in the branch of engineering of the candidate's choice. The following are some facts about GATE:<br> -->

          <!-- <br> -->
          
          <span style="font-weight: 900; font-size: 18px;">1. Importance of Mastering Concepts:</span><br> There is a difference between knowing a concept and mastering a concept. You can master a concept only when you apply it in a variety of contexts, and solve many different kinds of problems involving that concept. For example, consider the basic concept of orthogonality. We have orthogonality of vectors (linear algebra), signals (analog/digital communication), and random variables and random processes (probability). A variety of questions can be framed in each of these aspects of orthogonality, and you should be thorough in your understanding of all these versions.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: 900;font-size: 18px;">2. Importance of fundamental subjects:</span><br>If you have a strong hold on Signals and Systems, then mastering the concepts in Analog/Digital Communication, DSP, Control Systems etc., becomes very easy. Similarly, if your electromagnetics basics are solid, then understanding transmission lines, waveguides, antennas and even semiconductor devices and network analysis becomes a simple task. Thus, it is important to have<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: 900;font-size: 18px;">3. Practice challenging problems</span><br> As we have discussed earlier, each GATE question is unique in its own way. It requires you to put together many different concepts. Also, since you have to answer 65 questions in 3 hours, you have less than 3 minutes per question; time is at a premium. It is necessary not only to know the concepts but also to connect the together quickly to get the correct answer. Therefore, it is very important to solve an exhaustive variety of challenging problems.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: 900;font-size: 18px;">4. Enjoy the learning process!</span><br> Joy and learning are not commonly found together, especially in a mathematically oriented branch like EC. But joy of learning forms the core philosophy at RLC. To become an EC expert, you need top-notch teachers. You also need an interactive classroom environment where freely discussing a concept in all its aspects and exploring interconnections between concepts are encouraged. Such an approach makes the learning process interesting and enjoyable. For evidence, look at our <a href="../testimonials/index.html">testimonials</a> page!<br>

          <div class="pride"><span style="color:#00008B">BENEFITS</span>&nbsp;OF GATE</div>
          <div class="main-gate-info">
            A valid GATE score opens up many opportunities. The following are the main options after writing the GATE exam.
            <br><br>
            <span style="font-weight: 900;font-size: 18px;">1. PG programs at IISc and IITs</span><br>
With a very good rank in GATE, one has the “dream option” of joining IISc or IITs for postgraduate studies. In addition to the M.E/M.Tech courses, one can also join for the research programs (M.Sc(engg.)/PhD). The selected candidates get a monthly stipend. Top institutes like TIFR and IIIT also use GATE score in their admission process. Many of the NITs also have very good postgraduate programs, and one needs to have a very good GATE score to join those courses. More details here.
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 900;font-size: 18px;">2. PG programs at other Institutes</span><br>
Among those who join postgraduate programs at other colleges (private or government), only those with a valid GATE score get the monthly stipend.
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 900;font-size: 18px;">3. Job opportunities</span><br>
Many public sector companies, like BARC, NTPC, IOC, ONGC, CEL etc., now consider GATE score as a parameter in their recruitment process. In many of these companies, candidates with good GATE scores are directly called for interview.
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 900;font-size: 18px;">4. PG programs at universities abroad</span><br>
Many universities abroad, like NSU (Singapore) etc., consider GATE score in their admission process.
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: 900;font-size: 18px;">5. Quest for excellence</span><br>
Beyond all these opportunities that open up with a good GATE score, there is a more fundamental reason for writing the GATE exam. It is the standard barometer of your competence in your chosen field. It tests the depth of your understanding of the subjects that you have studied. It measures how far you have traveled in your quest for excellence. A good GATE score does your confidence a world of good! And the sense of achievement and happiness a top GATE score gives you cannot be matched!
<br></div>
<!-- <div class="pride"> How to excel&nbsp;<span style="color:#00008B">GATE</span>?</div>
        <div class="main-gate-info">
There is a widespread notion that GATE is not easy to crack, and that it is very difficult to get a good score in GATE. Is this true?
<br>
The answer is an emphatic <span style="color:red;font-weight: 900;">NO</span>! You only need proper preparation to excel in GATE. You don’t need to be a genius to get a rank under 100. You only need to be smart enough to prepare properly, along with a strong motivation towards excellence.
<br><br>
For an excellent performance in GATE, two things are essential:
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 900;">i. A comprehensive understanding of concepts</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: 900;">ii. Extensive Practice</span><br>
<br>
Let us consider the importance of concepts with a simple example:
<br><br>
<div class="mdex">The power of the signal x(t)=2 cos100πt-5 sin100πt is _____________</div>
<br>
The question is quite straightforward. To answer this question, you need to know the following concepts:<br>
<span style="font-weight: 900;">i. Power of a sinusoid</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: 900;">ii. Orthogonality of sin and cosine signals of the same frequency</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: 900;">iii. Power of a sum of orthogonal signals</span><br>
If you know these three concepts, the answer is direct. You’d probably have encountered such questions in your tests/exams. Now consider the next example:
<br><br>
<div class="mdex">The power of the signal x(t)=2 cos100πt-5sin[(100πt-π/3)] is _____________</div>
<br>
This question adds <span style="font-weight: 900;">phase shift</span> as a new parameter to the previous question. Now we cannot add the powers of the two components of <span style="font-weight: 900;">x(t)</span> directly.<br>
To answer this question, you need to know
<br>
The formula for <span style="font-weight: 900;">sin(A-B)</span>, so that <span style="font-weight: 900;">x(t)</span> can be expressed once again in terms of orthogonal components, or
<br>Phasor diagram<br>

<br>
Thus, the second question adds something extra to the first one, to make it more challenging. This is typical of GATE questions. In fact, the same concept can be tested in a broader context. Consider the following example:
<br><br>
<div class="mdex">The signal x(t)=cos100πt+2 sin[(120πt-π/3)] is SSB-USB modulated, with both the in-phase and quadrature carriers having an amplitude of 3V. The power of the modulated signal is ____________</div>
<br>
To answer this question, you should know
<br>
Whether the two components of x(t) are orthogonal<br>
To calculate the power of x(t), and the relation between the power of the message signal and modulated signal in SSB, or
<br>To plot the power spectrum of the modulated signal and find its power.<br>
From the examples discussed, we can make some observations:
<br>
A typical GATE question requires you to know many different concepts.<br>
You should also know how to connect the different concepts together to get the correct answer. <br>This is where practice helps.
Concepts in fundamental subjects like signals and systems form the basis of those in advanced subjects like communication. So you need to have a proper focus on fundamental subjects.
